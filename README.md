## Your Book of Recipes

Your Book of Recipes is a website that stores recipes, creating a personal recipe book. This includes a recipe scraper which can pull recipes from most recipe sites.

Your Book of Recipes is my first attempt at making a full-stack website without any tutorials to guide me. It is coded in TypeScript, using the NextJS framework, NextAuth, and TailwindCSS.

Some possible features to add:

```bash
Social features
Anonymous recipe sharing
Starter recipes for new users
Recipe images (including scraped images)
```
